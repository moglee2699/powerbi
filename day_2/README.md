## ðŸŽ¯ Objective

This project showcases my ability to **create, interpret, and enhance** one of the most essential Power BI visualsâ€”the **stacked column chart**. I focused on building an interactive visual that reveals deep insights across categories and promo types in a sales dataset.

The goal: **Transform raw data into actionable visuals that drive decisions.**

## ðŸ’¡ What I Did

### 1. **Stacked Column Chart Creation**
- Visualized **total sales** by **product category**.
- Used the **X-axis** for category names, **Y-axis** for sales values.

### 2. **Legend Integration**
- Added **promo types** to the **legend** to show sub-category distribution in each column.
- Made it easier to **compare promo effectiveness** across different product lines.

### 3. **Small Multiples (Faceting)**
- Demonstrated how to break down visuals by **city** using small multiples.
- Highlighted when this is useful, and when it's not (based on readability and layout).

### 4. **Interactivity**
- Enabled **click-based filtering** (cross-filtering) by selecting chart elements.
- Empowered users to **explore specific categories** and see related impacts on other visuals.
